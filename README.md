# Gene Expression Analysis 🧬

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline developed for diagnosing lung squamous cell carcinoma using gene expression data (FPKM). The project focuses on gene classification, tumor subtype discovery, and dimensionality reduction for precision oncology.  

🚀 **Key Features:**
* Classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
* Clustering: K-Means for tumor subtype discovery
* Dimensionality Reduction: PCA to enhance efficiency
